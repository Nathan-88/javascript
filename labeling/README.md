Labeling in JavaScript is a feature that allows you to associate a label with a specific loop (usually a for loop) or a switch statement. This label can then be used in conjunction with the break and continue statements to control the flow of execution within nested loops or switch cases.

Here's the syntax for labeling in JavaScript:

```javascript
labelName: for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // loop or switch body
}
```

labelName: This is the label you assign to the loop or switch statement.
for: This is the loop statement or the switch statement to which you are assigning the label.
initialization: This is where you initialize the loop control variable(s). It is executed before the loop begins.
condition: This is the condition that is checked before each iteration of the loop. If it evaluates to false, the loop terminates.
increment: This is where you update the loop control variable(s) after each iteration.

Once you have labeled a loop or switch statement, you can use the labeled statement break labelName; to exit the loop or switch early, and continue labelName; to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.

Here's an example of how labeling can be used:

```javascript
outerLoop: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    innerLoop: for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        if (i === 1 && j === 1) {
            break outerLoop; // This will break both loops
        }
        console.log(`i: ${i}, j: ${j}`);
    }
}
```
In this example, there's an outer loop labeled as outerLoop and an inner loop labeled as innerLoop. When the condition i === 1 && j === 1 is met, the break outerLoop; statement is executed, causing both loops to break and the program flow to exit the outer loop.

Labeling can be helpful when you have nested loops or complex switch statements and you want to control the execution flow at a higher level than a single loop or case. However, it's worth noting that excessive use of labeled loops can make code harder to read and understand, so it's recommended to use them judiciously.
