The new operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.

Classes can only be instantiated with the new operator — attempting to call a class without new will throw a TypeError
<!-- syntax -->
```js
new constructor(arg1, arg2, /* …, */ argN)
```
<!-- constructor -->
A class or function that specifies the type of the object instance.
