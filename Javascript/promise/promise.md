Imagine you promise to do something for your friend, like bringing them a gift tomorrow. A promise in JavaScript is similar. It's a placeholder for something that will happen in the future.

Let's break it down:

Promise Creation: You make a promise by creating a promise object. It's like saying, "I promise to do something."

Doing Something: Inside the promise, you write code to do whatever you promised. For example, fetching some data from the internet.

Resolve or Reject: Once you finish what you promised (like getting the data successfully), you 'resolve' the promise. If something goes wrong (like you couldn't get the data), you 'reject' the promise.

Handling Results: Your friend needs to know what happens with your promise, right? In JavaScript, you handle this using .then() and .catch(). If the promise is resolved, you do something with the result in .then(). If it's rejected, you handle the error in .catch().

Here's a tiny example:
```js
// Creating a promise
let fetchingData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Doing something (fetching data)
  let data = fetchDataFromInternet();

  if (data) {
    // If successful, resolve the promise
    resolve(data);
  } else {
    // If something went wrong, reject the promise
    reject("Couldn't fetch data");
  }
});

// Handling the promise
fetchingData.then((result) => {
  // If promise is resolved, do something with the result
  console.log("Data fetched successfully:", result);
}).catch((error) => {
  // If promise is rejected, handle the error
  console.log("Error:", error);
});
```

Promises in JavaScript have three possible states:

Pending: This is the initial state of a promise. When a promise is created, it's in the pending state. This means that the asynchronous operation associated with the promise hasn't completed yet. It's like saying, "I'll do something, but I haven't done it yet."

Fulfilled: A promise is fulfilled when the asynchronous operation it represents has completed successfully. It means that whatever task the promise was supposed to do has been completed, and the result (or value) of that task is available. It's like saying, "I've done what I promised, here's the result."

Rejected: If the asynchronous operation associated with the promise fails or encounters an error, the promise is rejected. This means that the task couldn't be completed as expected, and there's an error or reason why it failed. It's like saying, "I couldn't do what I promised, here's why."
