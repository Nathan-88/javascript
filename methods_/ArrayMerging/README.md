In JavaScript, .push.apply() is a method that was commonly used to merge elements from one array into another. However, it's important to note that .push.apply() has become less common due to the introduction of more modern array manipulation methods like spread syntax ([...array]) and the .concat() method, which offer cleaner and more readable ways to achieve the same result.

.push.apply() involves two parts:

- push: The push() method is a built-in function in JavaScript arrays that allows you to add one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the updated length of the array.

- apply: The apply() method is used to invoke a function with a given this value and an array (or an array-like object) of arguments. It's a method inherited by all JavaScript functions and allows you to execute a function in the context of a specific object while passing an array of arguments.

When used together, .push.apply() was a way to apply the push() method on an array using the elements of another array as arguments. This allowed you to effectively merge two arrays by pushing the elements of one array into another.

Here's an example of how .push.apply() used to be used:

```javascript
var array1 = [1, 2, 3];
var array2 = [4, 5, 6];

// Using .push.apply() to merge array2 into array1
Array.prototype.push.apply(array1, array2);

console.log(array1); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
However, the same result can be achieved more elegantly using modern JavaScript techniques:

Using the .concat() method:

```javascript
var array1 = [1, 2, 3];
var array2 = [4, 5, 6];

var mergedArray = array1.concat(array2);

console.log(mergedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Using the spread syntax:

```javascript
Copy code
var array1 = [1, 2, 3];
var array2 = [4, 5, 6];

var mergedArray = [...array1, ...array2];

console.log(mergedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

In conclusion, while .push.apply() used to be a useful way to merge arrays in older versions of JavaScript, it's recommended to use more modern and readable approaches like .concat() or spread syntax to achieve the same result in today's code.
