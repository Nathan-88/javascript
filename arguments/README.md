In JavaScript, the process.argv array contains the command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script. By default, the process.argv array includes two elements: the first element is the path to the Node.js executable, and the second element is the path to the script file being executed.

Therefore, if no additional arguments are passed, the process.argv array will have a length of 2. If one or more arguments are passed, the length of the process.argv array will be greater than 2.

In the original code provided, it checks if the length of process.argv is equal to 2 to determine if there are no additional arguments passed. This assumption is based on the fact that the first two elements of process.argv are present by default.
